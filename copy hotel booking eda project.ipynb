Next, I eliminated some columns that weren't needed for the analysis and added some that were. Using this data frame, I investigated a few variables using heatmaps, pie charts, count plots, and barplots, among other visualization charts, and I was able to uncover some significant findings.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Write Problem Statement Here.**"],"metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Define Your Business Objective?**"],"metadata":{"id":"PH-0ReGfmX4f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We will be analyzing a dataset of hotel bookings in this project.
